# DCMN-Hofstad-Notes---Katherine-Chevon-Testimony
"Aaron has been stealing valuables, houses, and identities since he was a teenager. I stuck with him because I thought one day we would hit big. When he stole the Secret Service ID everything changed. I thought I would be on a boat right now, but all Mike does is hang out with Brian and kill children. He says he is being forced by a Chinese submarine commander but I know for sure it is Brian Hofstad." - Katherine Chevon

"They think they are going to take over the world because Cory is going nowhere because we took out anyone who would even hire him after we took over the airport. I was Erika Devos, I set this up. Cory found out who I was at ActivSpace as Maria Perezanin. I can't give up because we are willing to go to war to kill your species. Your species is weak. You are physically strong but you are not willing to kill to survive." - Katherine Chevon
